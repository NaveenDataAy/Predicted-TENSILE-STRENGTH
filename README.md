# Predicted-TENSILE-STRENGTH
The future can be foretold by using prediction, and one can also use it to determine the likelihood of a certain result. In addition to this, it can be utilised to make projections on future needs or carry out "what-if" analyses. Regression analysis is a method that may be used to make predictions since it can determine the link between two variables (in the case of single regression) or between more than two variables (multiple regression). The process of using data to forecast future patterns or happenings is known as predictive analytics. Using historical data, predictive analytics attempts to make predictions about possible future events and then employs these forecasts to steer strategic decisions with regard to a company's operations.

MLAs were used to predict and classify the tensile strength of polymeric films of various compositions as a function of processing conditions. Two methods of film production were investigated: compression moulding and extrusion-blow moulding. Multi-factor experiments with corresponding parameters were designed. The tensile strength of samples was measured using a tensile test. Nine MLA were used to develop predictive and classification models.
